# Hardware

## Install the SSD

1. Unscrew the single large screw in the back of the computer
2. Slide off the case
3. Carefully pinch and remove the HDD caddy (unclip the SATA cable, it's likely zip-tied on so it doesn't rattle around)
4. Pop the SSD into the caddy
5. Install the SATA ribbon
6. Close up the case
7. Optional: with the case off, flip it over and slide off the *back* of the case to install more RAM or to replace the m.2 NVME
