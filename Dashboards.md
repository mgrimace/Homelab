If you use ibramenu, it creates a convenient dashboard already for each LXC that you use the service on.

The issue is that you may want different services on different dashboards. 

The easiest way to do this is to go to 

/opt/appdata/ibradashy and edit the conf.yml, then copy/paste in the containers + IPs for each into one prime dashy.

Do this on a separate lxc just in case. just use the prebuilt lxc
