# Using Dashy

- If you use ibramenu, it creates a convenient dashboard already for each LXC that you use the service on.
- The issue is that you may want different services on different dashboards. 

- The easiest way to do this is to go to 

- `/opt/appdata/ibradashy` and edit the conf.yml, then copy/paste in the containers + IPs for each into one prime dashy.
