########################### THIS COMPOSE FILE
# This compose file contains services that are tunnelled by CloudFlare

### ANCHORS
# - The following anchors serve as my baseline info that is included in most of my containers
# - Default behavior is to include all entries below '&home-lab-default' by adding <<: *homelab-default to each container 
# - To add additional env args and labels to a container, I can still use the defaults with <<: &env and <<: &labels, then add additional entries
